# Codesoft
Welcome to my Codsoft internship repository! This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship with Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and classification. Below are brief descriptions of each project:

1. Titanic Survival Prediction
  Objective: Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models.

  Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
  Techniques Used: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
  Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more.
  Outcome: Developed a predictive model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors with high accuracy.
  
2. Iris Flower Classification
   Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their features.

   Dataset: Kaggle Iris Dataset
   Techniques Used: Data visualization, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
   Models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks, and others.
   Outcome: Built an accurate classifier to distinguish between different iris flower species.
   
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
   Objective: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

   Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
   Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, undersampling, oversampling (SMOTE), model training, and evaluation.
   Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others.
   Outcome: Developed a robust model to identify fraudulent transactions with a focus on reducing false positives and false negatives.
